# Evolutionary Computing
 
genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic programming, differential evolution, particle swarm optimisation. 

Applications in optimisation, constraint handling, machine learning, and robotics are discussed. 

Specific subjects handled include: genetic structures (representations), selection techniques, sexual and asexual reproduction operators, (self-)adaptivity and methodological aspects, such as algorithm design and tuning.
